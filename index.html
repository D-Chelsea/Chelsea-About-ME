            <h3>About Chelsea</h3>
            <p>As a child growing up, I loved playing any kind of games with custimization aspects to them. This later doveloped into me customizing my social media webpages to look <em> exactly</em> how I wanted it to look. Doing this required me to learn basic coding elements.</p> 
            
            <p>Now, a couple years later, I discovered the <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> program to get me on track for my sofware engineering career and put my passion into the real world and have fun doing it!</p>
            <p>if you're looking to hire a new doveloper to become a member of your team or colaborate on a project, please reach out!</p>
